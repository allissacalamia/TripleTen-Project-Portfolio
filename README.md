# TripleTen-Projects

Welcome to my Automated Testing Sprint Projects repository! This repository showcases a few automated testing projects that were developed during dedicated sprints. These projects leverage advanced techniques, frameworks, and tools to enhance software quality, streamline development workflows, and ensure robustness. This README file serves as a guide to understanding the purpose, features, and usage of each project.

Project: createAnOrder.e2e.js - Write automated tests covering the full process of ordering a taxi in the Urban Routes web application. 
This project focuses on the ability to write automated tests using Selenium to facilitate easy test creation, execution, and result analysis. The project follows industry best practices and provides extensive documentation on writing effective test cases. The repository includes the sample code for this sprint. 

Project: getHandlers.test.js/ putHandlers.test.js/ postHandlers.test.js/ deleteHandlers.test.js -  select one endpoint from the grocery store documentation and write at least two tests: choose one endpoint from the Urban Grocers documentation and write at least two tests:
This project aims to achieve end-to-end testing for a complex software system. It focuses on simulating real-world user interactions and validating the functionality across various user scenarios. The project utilizes Node.js to create and execute automated tests for user interfaces, APIs, and backend systems. The repository includes the sample code for this sprint.
