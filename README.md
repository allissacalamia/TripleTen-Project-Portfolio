# TripleTen-Projects

Welcome to my Testing Sprint Projects repository! This repository showcases testing projects that were developed during dedicated sprints. These projects include advanced techniques, frameworks, and tools to enhance software quality. This README file serves as a guide to understanding the purpose, features, and usage of each project. 

Project 1: Testing the Urban Routes web application. 
In this project I tested the basics of the Urban Routes app and reported all bugs in Jira. The repository includes the Jira project link for this sprint.  

Project 2: Creating a mindmap and a flowchart, as well as designing test cases for calculating travel time and cost for the Urban Routes web application. 
In this project I analyzed and decomposed the requirements, created partition equivalence classes, and designed several basic test cases for the Urban Routes web application. The repository includes the Google doc for this sprint.  

Project 3: Testing the web application: Urban Routes. 
In this project I wrote test documentation to implement new features ie. Carsharing. I then reported any bugs found on new and existing features in Jira. I used Charles Proxy to create a new feature: an aerotaxi option. I then tested the new aerotaxi feature and reported all bugs found in Jira. The repository includes the Google doc for this sprint. 

Project 4: Testing Urban Grocers API.  
In this project I designed tests as a checklist to cover the features received for testing, tested the Urban Grocers API through Postman, and created bug reports in Jira for any bugs found. The repository includes the Google doc for this sprint. 

Project 5: Working with the database of a taxi service. 
In this project I used SQL and Terminal to determine which requests came from a particular IP address. I then investigated bugs by examining logs for error codes, as well as found, calculated, and sorted numbers in a database of taxi rides in Chicago. The repository includes the Google doc for this sprint. 

Project 6: Testing the Android mobile application: Urban Lunch. 
In this project I created test cases for Urban Lunch in google sheets, executed the tests using Android Studio, and reported bugs in Jira. The repository includes the Google doc for this sprint. 

Project 7: getHandlers.test.js/ putHandlers.test.js/ postHandlers.test.js/ deleteHandlers.test.js - Creating and testing HTTP requests using the Urban Grocers API. 
In this project I created HTTP requests in JavaScript, using the Urban Grocers API. I then parsed the data as JSON and wrote a tests to check the status code of the API response. I then went on to test more specifics, like being able to create a kit with a specific name. In this project I utilized apiDOC, VS CODE, JavaScript, the computer terminal, and POSTMAN. The repository includes the sample code for this sprint. 

Project 8: Writing automated tests covering the full process of ordering a taxi in the Urban Routes web application. 
In this project I preformed 8 individual automated tests that all together were able to successfully order a taxi through the web app Urban Routes. For this project I utilized VScode, Javascript, the computer terminal, and DevTools. The repository includes the sample code for this sprint. 

Project 9: Theory testing, testing the Urban Scooter web application, testing the Urban Scooter mobile application, and Urban Scooter API testing. 
In this project I tested my theory behind qaulity assurance testing as a whole with an extensive theory exam. For the Urban Scooter web application I developed a mindmap, created a checklist to validate the fields, performed the tests specified in the checklist, and reported all bugs in Jira. For the Urban Scooter mobile application I used Android Studio to execute testing, created a courier using API documentation, created test cases containing the results of the tests, and reported all bugs using Jira. Using Postman I tested the back end of the Urban Scooter application as well. The repository includes the Google doc for this sprint.
