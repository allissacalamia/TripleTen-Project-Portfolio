# TripleTen-Projects

Welcome to my Automated Testing Sprint Projects repository! This repository showcases a few automated testing projects that were developed during dedicated sprints. These projects include advanced techniques, frameworks, and tools to enhance software quality. This README file serves as a guide to understanding the purpose, features, and usage of each project. 

Project: createAnOrder.e2e.js - Write automated tests covering the full process of ordering a taxi in the Urban Routes web application. 
In this project I preformed 8 individual automated tests that all together were able to successfully order a taxi. For this project I utilized VScode, Javascript, the computer terminal, and DevTools. The repository includes the sample code for this sprint. 

Project: getHandlers.test.js/ putHandlers.test.js/ postHandlers.test.js/ deleteHandlers.test.js - Creating and testing HTTP requests using the Urban Grocers API. 
In this project I created HTTP requests in JavaScript, using the Urban Grocers API. I then parsed the data as JSON and wrote a tests to check the status code of the API response. I then went on to test more specifics, like being able to create a kit with a specific name. In this project I utilized apiDOC, VS CODE, JavaScript, the computer terminal, and POSTMAN. The repository includes the sample code for this sprint.
